    <div class = "CN Interest"><h2>Code Nation Interest</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in having a job in something to do with computers and ever since I took the initial developer course
            in december last year it re-sparked my interest in coding as I found out I was really good at it and it just spoke to me as a language.
            Ever since then I've been studying up and increasing my knowledge further and been really enjoying it. So When the opportunity came to
            go on the masters course I instantly snatched up the chance and even though its only been one week so far I am loving it.
        </p></div>
    <div class = "TnG"><h2>Targets and Goals</h2></div>
        <p>My main goal in life is to own my own video game company and make the games I enjoy playing. Since i started coding again i'm picking
            up the knowledge and experience to make this happen.
