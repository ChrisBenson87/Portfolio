    <div class = "Education"><h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Well where to start. Born in 1987 I was born and raised in a little town called Walkden in Manchester UK. 
        After high school I went onto further education in college studying IT and Music Technology but after that
        I was stuck on what to do, get a job or something else. I found a course online with bolton university called
        Games Design and it peaked my interest since I am an avid video gamer so I did that for 4 years.</p></div>
    <div class = "Work"><h2>Work</h2>
        After finishing university nothing really came from it as a carrer so I went and started to look for work.
        I've had a few different jobs over my time including Data Entry, Warehouse, Retail and Hospitality. These
        were all good jobs but I was just bouncing around different jobs and didn't really feel like it was for me.</p></div>
    <div class = "Experience"><h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Once the pandemic hit I lost my stable job and was looking around for a while on what to do. Then I saw a
        beginners course at Code Nation in Manchester which peaked my interest so I decided to give it a shot. It
        re-sparked my intrest and gave me a new found understanding of coding. So once I finished that I wanted to
        study further so I did on my own and then this masters course popped up. I signed onto that and am currently
        working through it at the moment.</p></div>
    <div class = "Skills"><h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>Worked with Python in the past and refreshed my knowledge recently. Now learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.

    <div class = "Personals"><h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>During my time on these courses I have made my own personal fan website which I was really proud of as it only took
        me 2 days to do it along with content and styling.
